In the second phase of our study, we used NHS II in order to validate statistically significant associations that we found in the original NHS. We examined the relationship between 53 exposures found in NHS with CHD risk and deemed an exposure tentatively validated if it had achieved FDR $< 0.05$ significance in NHS and achieved nominal statistical significance in NHS II (P-value < 0.05). Tentatively validated exposures in NHS II had the same directional effect on CHD risk as in original NHS. A list of validated and non-validated associations is provided in the SI.
